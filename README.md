Goenv helps you to work with multiple `golang` versions at the same time whether on mac or linux operating system. It supports both global and per-application version configuration.


## Usage

Download [the latest `goenv` binary](https://github.com/clivern/Goenv/releases). Make it executable from everywhere.

```zsh
$ export GOENV_LATEST_VERSION=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/clivern/Goenv/releases/latest" | jq '.tag_name' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/' | tr -d v)

# For Linux
$ curl -sL https://github.com/clivern/Goenv/releases/download/v{$GOENV_LATEST_VERSION}/goenv_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz

# For Mac (Arm M chips)
$ curl -sL https://github.com/clivern/Goenv/releases/download/v{$GOENV_LATEST_VERSION}/goenv_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz | tar xz


# For Mac (Intel)
$ curl -sL https://github.com/clivern/Goenv/releases/download/v{$GOENV_LATEST_VERSION}/goenv_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
```

Configure the goenv using the following command

```zsh
$ goenv config
```

Add `goenv` shims to `PATH` using the following command. also append it to `~/.profile` file to make it permanent.

```zsh
$ export PATH="$HOME/.goenv/shims:"$PATH

# OR

$ eval "$(goenv init)"
```

Install a new `go` version `1.18` and set as a global

```zsh
$ goenv install 1.18
$ goenv global 1.18
```

To configure a local version different from the global

```zsh
$ goenv local 1.18
```

To Uninstall a version

```zsh
$ goenv uninstall 1.18
```

Show the used version either from current directory or parent directories or the global version.

```zsh
$ goenv version
```

To list all installed versions

```zsh
$ goenv versions
```

for a list of all available commands

```zsh
$ goenv --help

## Under The Hood

Goenv is inspired by and works like `rbenv`. At a high level, `goenv` intercepts `Go` commands using `shim` executables injected into your `PATH`, determines which Go version has been specified by your application or globally, and passes your commands to the correct `Go` installation `bin` folder.

**Understanding PATH**

When you run a command like `go` or `gofmt`, your operating system searches through a list of directories to find an executable file with that name. This list of directories lives in an environment variable called `PATH`, with each directory in the list separated by a colon:

```
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

Directories in `PATH` are searched from left to right, so a matching executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes precedence over another one at the end. In this example, the `/usr/local/bin` directory will be searched first, then `/usr/bin`, then `/bin`.

**Understanding Shims**

`goenv` works by inserting a directory of shims at the front of your `PATH`:

```zsh
~/.goenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

Through a process called rehashing, `goenv` maintains shims in that directory to match every `Go` command across every installed version of `go` like `gofmt` and so on.

`shims` are lightweight executables that simply pass your command to the right binary under the current go version, your operating system will do the following:

1. Search your `PATH` for an executable file named `gofmt`.
2. Find the goenv shim named `gofmt` at the beginning of your `PATH`
3. Run the shim named `gofmt`, which in turn fetch the target go version and use the `gofmt` inside `go/bin` directory.

**Choosing the Go Version**

When you execute a shim, `goenv` determines which Go version to use by reading it from the following sources, in this order:

1. The first `.go-version `file found by searching the current working directory and each of its parent directories until reaching the root of your filesystem. You can modify the `.go-version` file in the current working directory with the `goenv local x.x.x` command.
2. The global `$HOME/.goenv/.go-version` file. You can modify this file using the `goenv global x.x.x` command.


## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Goenv is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/) and release process is predictable and business-friendly.

See the [Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/clivern/goenv/releases) for changelogs for each release version of Goenv. It contains summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release. Also see the [Milestones section](https://github.com/clivern/goenv/milestones) for the future roadmap.
